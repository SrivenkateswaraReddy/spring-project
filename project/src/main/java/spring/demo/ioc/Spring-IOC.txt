Spring Inversion of Control
It is a technique to achieve the loose coupling between objects and dependencies (IOC)
Inject objects and dependencies (Dependency Injection)

we-will be using XML configuration
1 configure spring beans
2 Create Spring container
Specialized implementations
            ####
Class PathXmlApplicationContext
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
GenericWebApplicationContext
etc
3. Retreving the values from container


What is Spring Bean?
A Spring Bean is a simple Java object.

when java objects are created by spring container then Spring refers them as Spring Beans

Spring beans are created from normal java classes just like java Objects.


what is dependency injection?
spring container injects objects into other objects or dependencies provides loose coupling and provides easy access to spring Ioc.

two injection types
Constructor injection
Setter injection
auto-wiring

dependency interface and class
create a constructor in you class for injections
configure the dependency injection in spring config file.

Setter injection
inject dependency by calling setter methods on the class

create setter methods in your class files for injections
configure the dependency injection in spring config file

Injecting literal values
Create setter methods in your class files for injections
configure the dependency injection in spring config file


Scope of beans

What is Singleton?
Spring Container creates only one instance of the bean, by default

it will be in the cache memory

All requests for the bean
will be shared reference to the Same Bean.
